This presentation aims to analyze 2023 U.S. domestic flight data to identify patterns and use machine learning to predict flight delays. By leveraging historical and real-time data, the goal is to provide actionable insights that can improve flight punctuality and reduce the economic impact of delays. It includes a demonstration of a user-friendly interface built with Streamlit, allowing users to test the predictive model by entering flight details and viewing predicted delay types. Key sections of the presentation cover data summary, visual analysis, predictive modeling, key performance indicators (KPIs), and strategic insights, which together outline the methodologies and findings of this analysis.
